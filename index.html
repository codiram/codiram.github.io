    <h1>Climate Change, The Scapegoat of Unplanned Urbanization?</h1>
    <header>
        Kathmandu Valley has faced increasingly frequent flash floods with dangers heightened by climate change and rapid urbanization<sup><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a></sup> and unplanned urban enchroachment around bagmati river.<sup><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/what-caused-the-devastating-floods-in-nepal">(4)</a></sup>
        The recent floods of September 26 to 28, 2024 were well forecasted by the department of hydrology and meteorology but it's unclear to what extent the warning led 
        to early action<sup>                <a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/news/rapid-urbanisation-and-climate-change-key-drivers-dramatic-flood-impacts-nepal">(3)</a></sup>.
        The extreme heavy rainfall which was the highest ever recorded in 54 years<sup>                <a href="https://www.dhm.gov.np/downloads">(5)</a></sup> caused landslide, flashfloods and riverine
        flooding in Bagmati, Sapotakoshi, Narayani, Sardu, Rew and Nakkhu rivers and their tributaries.
        244 people were killed in this event.<sup><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a></sup>
    
<br>
<br>
    
        Kathmandu Valley's unique geography makes is susceptible to flooding.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>

        Situated in a valley with few natural drainage points, the region has historically experienced periodic floods especially during monsoon 
        season.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a>
        </sup>

        These floods were once beneficial to bring soil restoring silt to farms.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup> However, in recent decades these floods have
        become more destructive often referred to as flash floods due to rapid rise of river levels.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a></sup>

        Unplanned urbanization is a major culprit in this; Kathmandu quadrupled in settlement between 1980 and 2010 and continues to expand rapidly
        <sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>

        This urban sprawl has come at the expense of valley's natural drainage system and hydrological integrity.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>

            <h3>Loss of open spaces and wetlands</h3>

            The conversion of open spaces and wetlands into concrete surfaces has significantly reduced the land's capacity to absorb rain-water<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup> this results in increased surface runoff leading to faster and more intense flooding.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>
        </section>  
        
        <section>
            <h3>Destruction of Sand Hillocks</h3>

            Widespread bulldozing of sand hillocks known as ढिस्को (Dhisko) in Nepali, has removed a crucial natural water storage system.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>
            These hillocks used to store rainwater and release it slowly, mitigating flood peaks.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>

            <h3>Enchroachment on Floodplains</h3>

            Buildings including homes, began apperaing on valley's floodplains in the 1970's.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup> A 1986 report by the Government of Nepal & 
            USAID warned againsted this practice predicting severe problems due to the inherent flood risk in these areas.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>
        </section>


        <section>
        <h3>Altered Riverbeds</h3> 
            Kathmandu's rivers, characterised by the wide, sandy riverbeds and meandering courses have been significantly altered
            .<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup> Stone walls now constrain many rivers, squeezing them into narrower channels,
            reducing their capacity to hold flood waters.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h3>Covered and Built Over Streams</h3> 
            Many small seasonal, streams (kholsi)  that once played a role in draining the valley have been covered 
            or built over.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>
        
            These disrupts their natural flow patterns and can lead to unexpected flooding when heavy rain occurs.<sup><a href="https://nepalitimes.com/banner/kathmandus-flash-floods-are-4-decades-in-the-making">(1)</a></sup>
        </section>


        <section>
        <h3>Climate Change</h3>

            Climate change, especially the incrasing frequency & intensity of extreme rainfall events is likely contributing to Nepal's 
            flood problems.<sup><a href="https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/30780">(2)</a><a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/news/rapid-urbanisation-and-climate-change-key-drivers-dramatic-flood-impacts-nepal">(3)</a><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/what-caused-the-devastating-floods-in-nepal">(4)</a></sup>
        
            However, experts caution against using climate change as a scapegoat for the a lack of proper urban planning and river management.<sup><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/what-caused-the-devastating-floods-in-nepal">(4)</a><sup>
